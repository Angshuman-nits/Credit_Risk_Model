# Credit Risk Model Validation & Optimization  
**Model Validation Team — Intern (May 2025 – July 2025)**

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains work performed during a model validation internship focused on credit risk modeling and governance. The goal was to validate, optimize and harden a credit default prediction model using industry-grade feature engineering, model tuning and robust validation metrics to support model governance and stakeholder decision-making.

Key contributions:
- Designed feature-selection workflow (WOE–IV) to remove multicollinearity and improve interpretability.  
- Implemented and tuned XGBoost models using systematic hyperparameter search for better discrimination and predictive stability.  
- Performed rigorous model validation using advanced metrics (MCC, Brier Score, DPI) and produced diagnostic reports with actionable recommendations.

## Highlights / Key Features
- **Feature Engineering & Selection**
  - Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation and Information Value (IV) based binning.
  
- **Modeling**
  - XGBoost as the primary predictive model with structured hyperparameter tuning.
  - Baseline model comparisons to evaluate uplift from feature engineering and tuning.
- **Validation & Governance**
  - Use of metrics beyond accuracy: Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Brier Score, and Discriminatory Power Index (DPI).
  - Comprehensive diagnostic reports for stakeholders covering model performance, stability, and interpretability.
- **Reproducibility**
  - Notebook(s) and scripts to reproduce experiments, tune hyperparameters, and generate validation reports.
